# PyDC
A Dragon Code en/decoder written in Python

## Why create this program?
Sure, there are other Dragon Code interpreters out there. I'm doing this because I want to.

## What is the Dragon Code?
The Dragon Code is a way to describe a dragon using a relatively short block of text. Dragon Codes are often appended, as signatures, to Usenet or email messages.

## What do I need before I can run this program?
The graphical part of the program, PyDC-gui.py, requires [PyQT 5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro). Both parts of the program are written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and thus will require a Python interpreter.
