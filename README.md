# PyDC
A Dragon Code en/decoder written in Python

## Why create this program?
Sure, there are other Dragon Code interpreters out there. I'm doing this because I want to.

## What is the Dragon Code?
The Dragon Code is a way to describe a dragon using a relatively short block of text. Dragon Codes are often appended, as signatures, to Usenet or email messages.
